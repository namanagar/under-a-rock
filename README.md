## Key Features

News is, at its foundation, people, places, and ideas in an interconnected, continually-developing web.

Online news media like Twitter or Facebook traditionally present news as a list of discrete stories. However, in reality, news is not discrete; stories are intertwined and constantly evolving. Presenting news in the traditional way fundamentally inhibits quick comprehension of what's going on.

* See the connections between news topics.
  - Your brain naturally forms links between information as you learn it - and the visual nature means less time spent reading the news and more time doing other things.
* Pick the topics you want to read about.
  - No more scrolling through dozens of headlines to find what you're interested in - just click on topics you want to read about to filter the article list. 
* Algorithm generated, no hand curation.
  - Traditional email newsletters like the NYTimes' First Draft are inherently biased by their hand-curated nature. We just show you what's being written about the most.
